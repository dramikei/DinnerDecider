# DinnerDecider

Simple app to help you decide what to have for dinner!

# How does it Work?

Its working is really really simple, It has an array of Strings(Food Items). When clicked on the Decide button picks a random item from the Array.

When you add an element and hit the add button, a simple If-else conditions are executed to verify that what you're entering is actually a string and not some empty String value, if the conditions are met, then the String Value is added to the Food Array. (Though the Data added manually doesnt persist)
